My CS241 project converted from Java to Scala.  JWars, a 2d shooter game.  I've
included a makefile to build the project.  So simply run make to build the game
and then make run to start it.

Per github, where I keep my code, I found that I was able to delete 295 lines
of code from the project.  Much of this was because I don't need getters and
setters in Scala which makes it very easy to access fields for every class.

To build the game, simply run "make".
To run the game, simply run "make run"
