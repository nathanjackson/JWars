JWars
Created by: Nathan Jackson

JWars is a 2d shooter game written in Java using Swing and the abstract window toolkit (event handlers).  The project is currently a simple game and was originally created as a school project.  Current state of the project is very basic, very primitive.  In fact, there may be bugs.  Feel free to play with the code.  I do ask however that you mention my name in the comments!

To see a demonstration of my project, here is a YouTube video: http://youtu.be/4ZQ7nGVL3vc

To build:
Requires:
	scala
	JRE 6 or greater
	JDK 6 or greater
	make

1. Create a directory called classes
2. Build: Run 'make'
3. To Run: run 'make run'

Somethings I'd like to see changed or improved:
The XWing movement is sporadic.  I'm using event timers, I know that has something to do with it, but I haven't come up with a solution to fix it.
Makefile fixed, I don't know much about them! :)
Explosions don't occur at the point of impact
Lasers move slowly (due to project requirements)
No loss condition and a very simple win condition of 300 points
Maybe add a main menu?
Remove the bottom panel and fire button.  Draw the score on the actual field of play?
Fixed sprites
